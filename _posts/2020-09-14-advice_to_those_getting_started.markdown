Coming close to the tail end of my program, I thought I would share some helpful tips I've accumulated over time to help those just starting on their coding journey. Some of you might have started with a good handle from getgo and might find the below too basic. For others, there might be some points that you still aren't integrating to your approach, so I figured I'd list them here for you 

1. **Get your local environment set up sooner rather than later**
* This step is not fun, and will likely take you some time (especially for users like myself that were using a Windows macihine). The sooner you tackle this to do, the sooner you get it out of the way. And on the bright side, the lionshare of the work was the initial setup, and require little customization afterwards
* The sooner you set up your environment, the better you can get and making good use of all its functionalities - so get that practice in earlier. 

2.  **Make use of the coding tools at your disposal**
* *Pry & Debugger* - you can use both of these to stop your code and retrace the steps to see if your code is working as it should. These will help identify where your mistakes are, so some familiarity in using them will go a long way in the long term
* *Console Log* - as you're trying to get your web application up and running, you can send some information to console log just to see if information is going through as you think it would. Especially once you are in JS or React/Redux and some of your code might have a few layers, this provides a good test. 
* *Rails Console* - for any applications you're building that are Rails based or use a Rails backend, you can use the console functionality to test your database. 
* *[Repl.it](https://repl.it/)* - A great resource to test out specific pieces of code and understand how they work 

3. **Learn how to search for answers**
* Chances are that if you are experiencing some difficulty, someone else has encountered something *very similar*. The advantage of learning the right vocabulary and syntax is that it can allow you to isolate the specific problem you're experiencing - rather than just "XYZ is not working". Being able to just plug your concise and specific problem into Google can save you a lot of time and trouble.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) will have many posted solutions that get upvoted. My advice here is to skip any response that either adds in too many steps or that does not immediately strike you as being directly applicable to the issue you're facing. Maybe with a little more searching, you can find a more applicable answer. And worst case, you can always come back to any response if you don't have any luck finding anything more helpful.
* One very helpful website is [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/). The advantage of this site is for example if there is any concept that you are not understanding, there are built-in coding examples you can use to run tests and figure out how something works. 

4. **Take advantage of the live coding videos**
* While this advice applies especially for working on your portfolio projects, it applies to your more involved labs as well. There is a large store of videos available at [Learn Instruct](https://instruction.learn.co/#/500) and a few (often older) videos are also available on YouTube. While you won't be able to model everything off of these videos, they will give you enough of a strong start where from there you'll then be able to focus primarily on items more specific to your project. 
* The advantages of these videos from Learn is that 1.) for project builds, they are designed in a way that will capture all or most of the project requirements and 2.) they provide a refresher in terms of specific concepts. The latter is helpful as sometimes easy to lose sight of how everything fits together in just the labs. 
* For project builds, I would add to make sure to only use as reference a video lecture that takes you through a project to completion - just to save you the hassle of having to figure any missing steps afterwards. 

Hope those can prove helpful, wish you the best on your learning journey and happy coding!
