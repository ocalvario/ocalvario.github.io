Apparently being someone interested in themes, I decided to make my Rails project also workout-focused as was my Sinatra app. The idea here was to create a "library" of exercises that different users could add in their own tips related to how to perform said exercises. The idea would be to have something handy and accessible someone can have while exercising as a reference for best practices. In part to meet some of the project requirements, I afterwards also added in the ability to create different workouts consisting of groups of these exercises. 

Using a Windows machine, I had some initial issues in terms of getting all the Rails functionality on a newly generated app to work properly with my Vscode editor. What ultimately solved this was taking a look at the pre-installed gems and removing some of the more superflous ones. There are probably more gems in my final project that could have been removed. My opinion is that you don't need a lot of gems to do this project - just the ones that have come up as you've done the readings and labs should be more than fine.

One feature that took a bit of time to implement was third party login. I looked around and while there were a lot of videos on the topic, I didn't find many of them helpful ... ultimately what worked best was referring back to the Learn.co material while also looking at some other example project submissions. One silly yet important piece of advice as you imlement this is to remember to restart your Rails server as you implement changes, or else you won't see the modifications implemented.

As you build your project, undoubtedly you'll run into some errors, which will prompt you to scurry over to Google in search of some fix. When you find something that works, you feel relieved and move on to the next issue to tackle. *However,* it is oftentimes the case that said solution may not be the most elegant bit of code, so make sure you take some time after to look through and make sure everything looks clean.

Overall, while stressful at times being stumped by different roadblocks - it is ultimately very rewarding to see your app unfold. It is very likely the case that someone else has met the exact same challenge your currently facing, so if you can't find a workaround .. keep looking! You'll get your app to work and it will be a great app at that.
