Continuing on with the health/workout related theme from the first project, I decided to make a workout tracking app for my Sinatra project. Specifically, this app allows users to log in different workouts and include exercises for said workouts. Since it had the extra dimension of the workouts, I knew it would add a layer of complication but I also knew it would be worthwhile to have. 

I made use of the Corneal gem to get the application started - although not after giving a whirl at just building each of the directories myself manually ... the first attempt was not useless though, as it did help me better understand the connections between the files.

One of the first things I'd recommend to those starting the project is to try and be resourceful on finding resources. Looking on YouTube, I found a very insightful walk through by Flat Iron's Aysan Isayo, who went through things at just the right pace to help me get started. I was also also able to find some blog posts that former students who made similar projects. While the projects were ultimately different from mine, being able to read through their issues & solutions as well as take a peak into their code made a big difference.

This project is where I think some of my basic coding skills improved - best practices like periodically commiting to github, making small tests to check if features are working, successfully deploying binding.pry, and just keeping an eye out for better ways to improve things. While this project had some frustrations in the begining, toward the end was very enjoyable being able to get new features rolling and stamping out different bugs.
