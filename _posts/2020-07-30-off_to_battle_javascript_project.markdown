For the JS project, I chose to abandon the previous fitness centric topics and instead transition to historical matters. Specifically, I wanted something that could help fellow students of history better understand the details surrounding past armed conflicts. As a start, my project focuses on the Napoleonic wars - providing some summary details on a few key battles and including a visual aid in the form of a piece of artwork concerning said battle (thankfully, no shortage of such pieces for Napoleon's excurions).

Setting up the backend was comparatively easy - after the coursework and last two projects, I was very comfortable with the Rails structure and was able to do everything relatively quickly. Based on some of the instructional videos I saw, this is merely the baseline expectation but hey - I'll take a victory when and how it comes.

The frontend, however, proved comparatively more challenging. I began with some resources that were more focused on a modular approach, but due to the incompleteness of said guide as well as some poor planning on my end (short circuiting some of the backend planning around model relationships as an example), I ended up reaching some roadblocks where I ultimately had to make the decision to restart ... tragic! On the plus side, the extra practice in Javascript coding will pay off I am 110% sure.

I found another instructional resource that proved more fruitful, and was able to get to a functioning MVP for the project. I tried to focus more on hitting the core requirements really than going above and beyond in adding extra features. This allowed me to futrther refine the coding supporting the features I did have, as well as help setup some better styling.

My biggest advice in this project is to make liberal use of the the various features aimed at helping you test your code: 

*  test out your model relationships in your rails console
*  console.log() variables and the outputs of functions to make sure things are working as you're expected
*  deploy debugger to tricky parts of your code so that you can go through and check how all the pieces are working with each other

Make good use of these features and you will be able to overcome the challenges you face. This project's complexities will be frustrating but you'll only build more confidence as a coder once you overcome them - and overcome you will!
