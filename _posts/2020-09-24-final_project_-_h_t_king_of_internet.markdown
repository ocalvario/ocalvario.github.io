I can't believe it, already at my final project! I recall my worries starting my first one, wondering how I would get my application to work. Since then, have gotten to hone in my skills across a few languages and build some interesting projects - so amazing to reach this milestone.

Going through this web development course, I think I would be poorly served without having any reference to the undisputed king of the internet - the CAT. The application has a directory of different cats which have corresponding fun gear - some of which are just for furry friends but some others that also can be used by their human friends. One can add and edit cats as well as add and delete gadgets. Lastly, the application has a link to find local cat adoption services.

To help in putitng the project together, I followed the videos on *Learn Instruct* for the expense tracker. As in other video instructions, this takes you most of the way there rather than through the complete build. That being said, the elements that are missing are relatively easy to figure out, so I still recommend following this video series. The instructor does a great job of explaining what each line of code is doing as you work through the live build, as well as does a lot of intra-build tests that will allow you to make sure all the functionalities are working as expected while you code (make sure to take some good notes!). 

As was the case in the prior times, this project really helped connect various of the Redux and React learning concepts. If you haven't done so already, highly recommend making sure you download the browser extensions to allow you to properly inspect React and Redux elements.

I always enjoy the styling work once I have my project elements up and running. The React framework makes this work flow easy given the very distinct application components. 

I wish all of those starting their final projects the very best of luck, and hope you can have some fun doing it!
